Use WADL instead of the adhoc description language I cooked up:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language

Encrypt the generated token. It contains too much free authority (the
name of the underlying resource).

Consider auto-renewing inbound subscriptions, based on the
hub.lease_seconds we're given at subscription validation time.

* 0.3 spec

- hub.secret signatures on subscriptions
- signatures on incoming messages (supply during generate_token?)
   - how to know which hub.secret, unless endpoint URLs have an
     argument
   - which means generate_token would have to return that arg, or a 
     201 with a Location header (generate_endpoint?)
- automagic subscription renewal
- (maybe) get rid of sync/async
- topic creation, if it makes sense
